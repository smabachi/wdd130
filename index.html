    <h2>Zimbabwe</h2>
    <img src="images/great-zimbabwe.jpg" alt="Great Zimbabwe ruins">
    <p> Great Zimbabwe is best known for its impressive stone structures, especially the Great Enclosure, built without
      mortar. These
      ruins are the largest in sub-Saharan Africa
      and served as a political, religious, and trade center. Great Zimbabwe controlled trade routes that linked the
      interior of Africa to the Indian Ocean coast, dealing in gold, ivory, and cattle. The word "Zimbabwe" comes from
      the
      Shona phrase "Dzimba-dze-mabwe", meaning “houses of stone.”</p>
